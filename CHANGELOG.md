# ðŸ“œ CHANGELOG - QuizNest

## [2.3.0] â€” 2025-06-21

### Added

- Age and grade level fields to Child model for better quiz targeting
- Parent can now set age and grade level when creating/editing a child profile
- Quiz generation API prompt now includes childâ€™s grade and age for simpler, grade-appropriate questions
- All quiz generation and child serializers updated to handle new fields


## [2.2.1] â€” 2025-06-21

### Fixed

- All Django/DRF APIViews and serializers updated for Pylance compatibility: type hints, explicit Dict[str, Any] for `validated_data`, `getattr` for related fields, and conditional access to resolve static checker issues
- Quiz creation now generates a guaranteed unique, non-empty `link_slug` using UUID to resolve IntegrityError and 500 errors when generating quizzes
- Regex extraction of OpenAI quiz questions made robust to prevent `.group()` on `None` matches (eliminates internal server errors for bad AI output)
- Reverse relationships on models now use correct `related_name` and type-safe access for static analysis and runtime safety

### Changed

- All quiz/question/lesson API logic now Pylance-friendly with zero type or attribute warnings in VS Code
