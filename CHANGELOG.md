## [2.5.1] â€” 2025-07-06

## [2.5.0] â€” 2025-07-06

### Added

- **Google Social Login**: Integrated Google OAuth2 authentication for seamless sign-in
- **Environment-based Email Configuration**: Added support for different email backends in development and production
- **Email Verification**: Configured email verification settings for production environments
- **Improved Docker Local Development**: Database password is now loaded from a root `.env` file (gitignored) instead of being hardcoded in `docker-compose.yml`. This is best practice and prevents secret scanning alerts.

### Changed

- Updated documentation to reflect new file structure and setup instructions

## [2.4.0] â€” 2025-07-05

### Added

- **Quiz Answer Submission**: New endpoint (`/quizzes/<quiz_id>/questions/<question_id>/submit/`) allows children to submit answers one by one.
- **Automatic Scoring & Rewards**: The submission API automatically checks answers, updates the attempt score, and awards tokens to the child's profile upon passing a quiz.
- **Token Spending API**: New endpoint (`/quizzes/rewards/spend/`) allows children to spend their earned tokens on virtual items like avatars and backgrounds.
- **AI-Powered Feedback Reports**: New endpoint (`/reports/generate/`) uses OpenAI to generate a personalized, encouraging feedback report for parents based on a child's incorrect answers.
- **API Versioning**: All backend APIs are now versioned under the `/api/v1/` prefix for better long-term maintenance and scalability.

### Fixed

- Resolved multiple bugs during testing, including a missing `Pillow` dependency, a corrupted virtual environment, and deprecated OpenAI model names (`gpt-4-vision-preview`).
- Corrected the OpenAI API payload structure for `gpt-4-turbo` to handle image URLs correctly.

## [2.2.1] â€” 2025-06-21

- Quiz creation now generates a guaranteed unique, non-empty `link_slug` using UUID to resolve IntegrityError and 500 errors when generating quizzes
- Regex extraction of OpenAI quiz questions made robust to prevent `.group()` on `None` matches (eliminates internal server errors for bad AI output)
- Reverse relationships on models now use correct `related_name` and type-safe access for static analysis and runtime safety

### Changed

- All quiz/question/lesson API logic now Pylance-friendly with zero type or attribute warnings in VS Code
